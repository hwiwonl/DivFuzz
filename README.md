# DivFuzz: Combining Greybox Fuzzers
:loudspeaker: *All of the codes in this repository were developed by me and brilliant members of DEFKOR for DEFCON25-26*

We competed against a hacking machine **MAYHEM** that won DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) at DEFCON 24 CTF. Following that, [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/index.html) made public all of the code for their hacking machine, **[MECHAPHISH](https://github.com/mechaphish)**. We redesigned and customized this incredible machine to prepare for upcoming hacking competitions in pursuit of human-computer hacking cooperation.
